# 2_qps_2_5_filling_factor_coulomb_dispersion

Files follow the naming pattern `N_particles.csv`, where `N` is the number of particles in a state with 2 quasiparticles at filling 2/5.

Each line in a CSV lists the relative angular momentum, the mean energy, and the associated MCMC sampling error for that state.
