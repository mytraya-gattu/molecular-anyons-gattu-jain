# 3_qps_3_7_filling_factor_coulomb_dispersion

Files follow the naming pattern `N_particles.csv`, where `N` is the number of particles in a state with 3 quasiparticles at filling 3/7.

Each line in a CSV lists the relative angular momentum, the mean energy, and the associated MCMC sampling error for that state.
